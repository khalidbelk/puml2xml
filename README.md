### Why and how was this project created ?

This project was born from my experience working on a university project, where we were required to create PlantUML diagrams and also deliver them in XML format. Logically, I thought "It shouldn't be that hard to find a PlantUML tool that does this". After searching for a while, I encountered an issue : either finding a solution was quite tedious for such a simple problem, or many users found issues with the tools provided by PlantUml.

After more digging, I finally found a Docker command line provided somewhere by PlantUML, which, by chance, worked for me. However, as a result, I wanted a more accessible, native tool, primarily to save others the hassle of facing the same situation as me in the future (and also as an excuse for myself to make a project in **OCaml** ^^).

This project was made possible by **reverse-engineering the given output**. For reference, you can find the .xmi output file [here](/diagrams/diagram.xml) and the .puml file I used [here](/diagrams/diagram.puml).
